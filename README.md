UPDATE: I've avandoned this shit idk if I'll ever finish it. Forwarders are becoming unnecessary now with Aroma so yeah.

This is V10lator's Ship of Harkinian forwarder which will be the base for all of my .rpx homebrew forwarders

Navigate to another branch for modified versions of this forwarder for other apps, as this master branch contains the unmodified forwarder (the only thing changed is the README you're currently viewing)
